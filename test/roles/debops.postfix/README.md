This role installs and manages [Postfix](http://postfix.org/), an SMTP server.

`debops.postfix` role is designed to manage Postfix on different hosts in
a cluster, with different "capabilities". At the moment role can configure
Postfix to act as:

* a null client: Postfix sends all mail to another system specified
  either via DNS MX records or an Ansible variable, no local mail is enabled
  (this is the default configuration);
* a local SMTP server: local mail is delivered to local user accounts;
* a network SMTP server: network access is enabled separately from other
  capabilities, to avoid exposing misconfigured SMTP server by mistake and
  becoming an open relay;
* an incoming MX gateway: Postfix will listen on the port 25 (default SMTP
  port) and process connections using `postscreen` daemon with automatic
  greylisting and optional RBL checking;
* an outgoing SMTP client: Postfix will relay outgoing mail messages to
  specified remote MX hosts, you can optionally enable SMTP client
  authentication, passwords will be stored separate from the inventory in
  `secret/` directory (see `debops.secret` role). Sender dependent
  authentication is also available.

More "capabilities" like user authentication, support for virtual mail,
spam/virus filtering and others will be implemented in the future.

This role can also be used as a dependency of other roles which then can
enable more features of the Postfix SMTP server for their own use. For
example, `debops.mailman` role enables mail forwarding to the configured
mailing lists, and `debops.smstools` role uses Postfix as mail-SMS gateway.
