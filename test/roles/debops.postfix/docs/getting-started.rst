Getting started
===============

An example playbook which uses ``debops.postfix`` role::

    ---

    - name: Manage Postfix instance
      hosts: all

      roles:
        - role: debops.postfix
          tags: postfix

This playbook should install ``postfix`` package along with its dependencies,
and configure the service with default values generated by Ansible.
